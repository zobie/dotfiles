Nate Zobrist's Dot Files
========================

These config files set up a system the way I like it. Right now I'm in the process of trying to merge all my config files into this one repository.


## Installation ##

git clone git://github.com/zobie/dotfiles.git  
cd dotfiles  
rake install  

 * create a new file dotfiles/private_settings that defines:
   * export GITHUB_USER='zobie'
   * export GITHUB_TOKEN='...'


## Environment ##

These scripts are mainly used on Mac OS X and Ubuntu. I'm in the process of merging in my configuration files from cygwin and Powershell also.
